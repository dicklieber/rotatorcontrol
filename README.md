# 4O3A Rotator Genius 
## rotctld Interface
Implements the HamLib rotctld network interface.

Written in Scala to allow write-once run anywhere.

*This should be added to HamLib but I haven't written any C code for about 20 years! And I want to use my new Rotator Genius with MacLoggerDX now.*


###Status
This the beginning of a work-in-progress.
- It only reade the Header (|h) from the Rotator Genius 
- IP addreses and ports are hard coded.
- It does get the current azimuth to MaxLoggerDX!
