rotatorcontrol.jar This runs on any operating system as long as you have installed java for your OS.

Install a version of java with javafx. I use Liberica from https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/
Choose JDK 11 LTS or later.  Scroll down to Package, under your operating system.
Then choose "Full JDK". The Full package has javafx baked in.
Once you have java installed you can run:

% java -jar rotatorcontrol.jar
